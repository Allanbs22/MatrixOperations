# MatrixOperations
A Java application where you can select a matrix size,
insert the values of each position of the matrix as fractions and do operations over those values.

Developed in 2017 with the help of José Jimenez, Georrfrey Carmona, Josué Calderón and James Mora.

HOW TO USE:

1 - Insert the size of the matrix you want to work with.

2 - Insert the values of each position of the matrix in fraction form (use 1 as denominator to work with integers.

3 - Select one of the available operations to do on the matrix:

    * Exchange rows
    
    * Multiply row by a scalar
    
    * Add the multiple of one row to another
    
4 - You can also see the process of the operations done to the matrix
